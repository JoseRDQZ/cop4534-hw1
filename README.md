Author: Jose Rodriguez
Date: June 9, 2025

Description:
-------------
This submission includes solutions for both problems in Homework 1.

Problem 1: Number of Islands
- Located in: P1 Number of Islands/numOfIslands.py
- Implements both DFS and BFS to count the number of islands in a 2D grid.
- Includes: logical explanation, time & space complexity, and method comparison.
- Sample output for provided test grid:
    DFS - Number of Islands: 3
    BFS - Number of Islands: 3

Problem 2: 8-Puzzle Solver
- Located in: P2 8 Puzzle Games/eightPuzzleGames.py
- Solves the 8-puzzle game using the A* search algorithm.
- Uses Manhattan distance as the heuristic (explained in comments).
- Includes: code, heuristic explanation, complexity analysis, and test case.

How to Run:
-------------
1. Open this folder using a Python-compatible IDE such as:
   - Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
   - PyCharm
   - Thonny
   - Spyder
   - Or any editor that supports running Python scripts

2. Navigate to the folder for either problem.

3. Open and run the corresponding `.py` file:
   - For Problem 1: `numOfIslands.py`
   - For Problem 2: `eightPuzzleGames.py`

4. The output will be printed in the IDE’s terminal or output panel.

No external libraries are required beyond Python 3’s built-in modules.
